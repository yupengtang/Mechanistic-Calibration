"""Repair the opponent rationales so each one actually argues for its target.

The first generation pass asked one model to justify a stated answer. It
complied for 499/500 rationales arguing for the ground-truth answer but for only
375/500 arguing against it: a quarter of the time the generator reverted to the
answer it believed correct. Those records would have put an *incoherent*
opponent in front of the model ("They answered: Yes. Their stated reason: <text
arguing No>") rather than the intended misleading-but-plausible expert.

This script re-generates only the non-compliant rationales, with an explicit
adversarial framing and a target-compliance retry loop, and records a per-item
`compliant` flag. This check verifies the leading answer, not the factual
correctness or sentence-level support of the rationale.

Output: rebuttal/data/opponent_rationales.json (in place, adds "compliant")
