"""Credibility-gradient conditions: uncertainty qualifier and track record.

Reviewer 15bh's W2 lists rationale, evidence, uncertainty, and track record as
realistic extensions. The A3_rat conditions cover rationale under the fixed
excerpt; they do not add independently validated external evidence. This script
adds uncertainty and track-record cues over an otherwise identical opponent
turn:

    A1        anonymous, no source description
    A4        neutral metadata, no reliability information
    A3_unc    expert, explicitly fallible  ("but they may be wrong")
    A3        expert
    A3_track  expert with a stated track record on similar questions

The targeted contrast is among the three expert conditions: explicitly
fallible, plain expert, and expert with a stated track record. Ordered reversal
across these conditions tests sensitivity to asserted source reliability rather
than merely to the word "specialized". A1 and A4 are reported as reference
conditions, not assumed positions on the same ordinal scale.

A3_unc reuses the registry's existing `A3_fallible` wording verbatim. A3_track
deliberately departs from the opponent-minimality policy: a track record is a
reliability claim by construction, and that is the point of the top rung.

Pass 1 is read back from the completed control runs, so the new rows stay
branch-paired with every condition already collected for the same item-model.
